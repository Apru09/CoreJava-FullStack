# Hibernate
I used Intellij idea as IDE and Maven as project build tool. This basically provides the structure or archtype (template) of the project required. The tool also keeps running
and updates the dependencies if added.

All dependencies are configured in pom.xml file. I have added hibernate from maven repository {https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.hibernate.orm/hibernate-core}

Hibernate properties are configured inside hibernate.cfg.xml file. Properties include database details (drivername, url, username and password). There are also other properties 
for table creation and stuff which I explained in the file itself. 

Go through all the files as I have given explanation to some content in the comments itself.
